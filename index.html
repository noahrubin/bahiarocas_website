                            <p class="description">
                                A breathtaking beachfront property on the Sea of Cortez, Casa Bahia Rocas is a 12,000 sq. ft. estate with expansive lawn, perfect for gathering with family and friends or intimate destination weddings. Inspired by colonial Spanish architecture, Saltillo tiles cover the floors, local pottery and glasswork decorates the rooms, and wrought-iron fixtures, intricate tile work and colorful linens reflect the artisanal skill and vibrant spirit of Mexican design.

                                Guests are welcomed to the home through the circular foyer which leads into Casa Bahia Roca’s magnificent great room that features vaulted wood-beamed ceilings, formal dining for twelve and seating area centered around a massive floor-to-ceiling stone fireplace. The perfect setting for entertaining and enjoying meals with friends and family, the gourmet kitchen is fully-equipped with stainless steel appliances, an adjacent prep kitchen, large island with breakfast bar seating, and pocket doors that lead out to an open-air dining table where meals can be enjoyed amid ocean breezes and amazing views of the Sea of Cortez.

                                The party continues in the villa’s stunning indoor bar and lounge area. The bar features beautifully-carved rich patina wood with a mirrored backdrop, inlaid stained glass and studded leather barstools lining the counter. For a fun and carefree movie night, the home also has a theater lounge with an impressive flat screen TV and comfy wrap-around sofa seating. Upstairs, is the spacious master suite, with private balcony.

                                 Bedrooms 2-7 surround the pool, each with their own access—similar to individual casitas, so the occupants are never disturbed by others coming or going. All with ocean views, king size beds and walk-in showers, except Bedroom 2, has two-bunk beds, with four queen size mattresses; and Bedroom 7, the Honeymoon Suite, is located Oceanside with private sitting area, fire-pit and spa. Bedrooms 8-9 are inside a separate guest casita adjacent to the tennis court. The casita has its own kitchen and living room, one of the bedrooms has two queen beds and the other has a king size bed. All bedrooms have walk-in showers, flat-screen TV, safes, and wifi accessible throughout the property.

                                The veranda welcomes relaxing afternoons lounging in the shade or an active game of ping-pong. The pool terrace is dotted with seating areas, outdoor day beds and reclining loungers with umbrellas. Water flows from the elevated spa into the gorgeous free-form infinity pool that meanders across the terrace. There is a swim-up bar under a pergola-shaded lounge area that looks out over the azure waters and pristine sands of Palmilla Bay.

                                At the edge of the property bordering the beach, a pillow-covered lounge area surrounds a massive fire pit where guests can relax to the sound of the waves rolling along the sand. Amenities at Casa Bahia Rocas are second to none. The villa has a full-time butler, a chef to prepare delicious breakfasts and lunch daily, lighted tennis court, and a golf cart for use at Palmilla's three world-class courses.  Casa Bahia Rocas is ideal for those seeking exceptional comfort and privacy, located within the exclusive and secure gated enclave of Villas del Mar, one of Los Cabos, premier resort communities.
